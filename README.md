Health Data Scientist with a robust academic background in biomedical sciences and advanced analytics. Currently pursuing a Master of Science in Health Data Science at UNSW, I blend comprehensive scientific knowledge with data analysis to transform complex healthcare information into meaningful insights.

My academic journey spans from a Neuroscience major at the University of Melbourne to advanced data science training, equipping me with a unique skill set in statistical modelling, healthcare analytics, and data visualisation. Proficient in Python and R, I specialise in leveraging data science techniques to address complex health research challenges.

With expertise in statistical data analysis, machine learning, and linked data, I am committed to bridging the gap between scientific research and actionable health insights. My interdisciplinary approach allows me to integrate molecular mechanisms, clinical perspectives, and population health data to drive informed decision-making.
